This game is called Crystal Collector, an interactive game for web browsers. The core objective of the game is to match the computer-generated number by selecting a combination of crystals.

## Design & Technology
* This application runs in the browser and is powered by JavaScript, using the jQuery library, to update the HTML page.
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap framework
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * jQuery library

## What the project does
* Four crystals are displayed as buttons on a page, each with a random number assigned but not displayed. 
* The game generates random numbers. The 1st assigns a target number to match. The 2nd assigns a different number to each crystal.
* The player is shown the number to match at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks a crystal, a specific amount of points are added to the player's total score.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number and looses if their score exceeds it.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* On restart new random numbers are generated.
* The player's overall wins and loses are tracked and displayed.

## Why the project is useful
This was an exercise in program flow and control using these web technologies:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.  

## Challenges
* This is a scoring game and an exercise in program flow and control.
* The application uses the useful JavaScript switch statement to perform different actions based on different conditions.
